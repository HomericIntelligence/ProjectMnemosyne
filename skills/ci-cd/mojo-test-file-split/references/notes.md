# Session Notes: Mojo Test File Split (Issue #3409)

## Session Context

- **Date**: 2026-03-07
- **Issue**: #3409 — fix(ci): split test_elementwise.mojo (37 tests) — Mojo heap corruption (ADR-009)
- **Branch**: `3409-auto-impl`
- **PR**: #4142

## Problem

`tests/shared/core/test_elementwise.mojo` contained 37 `fn test_` functions.
ADR-009 mandates ≤10 per file due to Mojo v0.26.1 heap corruption bug in
`libKGENCompilerRTShared.so`. CI failure rate was ~65% (13/20 recent runs).

## What Was Done

1. Read the original 1119-line test file to understand all 37 tests
2. Read `.github/workflows/comprehensive-tests.yml` to find the `Core Activations & Types` group
3. Read `scripts/validate_test_coverage.py` to understand coverage enforcement
4. Created 5 part files grouping tests by logical topic:
   - part1: abs, sign (5 tests)
   - part2: exp, log (8 tests)
   - part3: log10, log2, sqrt (8 tests)
   - part4: sin, cos (6 tests)
   - part5: clip, rounding, logical (10 tests)
5. Each file includes ADR-009 header comment and full imports
6. Deleted the original `test_elementwise.mojo`
7. Updated CI workflow pattern string to reference 5 new filenames
8. Committed — all pre-commit hooks passed on first attempt
9. Pushed and created PR #4142 with `gh pr merge --auto --rebase`

## Key Observations

- `validate_test_coverage.py` uses `rglob("test_*.mojo")` to discover ALL test files
  on disk, then cross-references them against the CI workflow. The original file must
  be deleted, not just removed from the pattern.
- Mojo has no `#include` mechanism; imports must be duplicated in every part file.
- The `--label fix` flag on `gh pr create` failed because that label doesn't exist
  in the repo; dropped the flag.
- Pre-commit hooks automatically ran `mojo format` on all 5 new files and passed.
- `validate_test_coverage.py` pre-commit hook passed, confirming CI pattern update was correct.

## Files Changed

- `tests/shared/core/test_elementwise.mojo` — DELETED
- `tests/shared/core/test_elementwise_part1.mojo` — CREATED (5 tests)
- `tests/shared/core/test_elementwise_part2.mojo` — CREATED (8 tests)
- `tests/shared/core/test_elementwise_part3.mojo` — CREATED (8 tests)
- `tests/shared/core/test_elementwise_part4.mojo` — CREATED (6 tests)
- `tests/shared/core/test_elementwise_part5.mojo` — CREATED (10 tests)
- `.github/workflows/comprehensive-tests.yml` — UPDATED (pattern string)

# Session Notes: Mojo Test File Split (Issue #3424)

## Session Context

- **Date**: 2026-03-07
- **Issue**: #3424 — fix(ci): split test_utility.mojo (31 tests) — Mojo heap corruption (ADR-009)
- **Branch**: `3424-auto-impl`
- **PR**: #4189

## Problem

`tests/shared/core/test_utility.mojo` had 31 `fn test_` functions, exceeding ADR-009's limit of
≤10 per file. The issue description claimed 25 tests — actual count was 31. This caused
intermittent heap corruption crashes in Mojo v0.26.1 (`libKGENCompilerRTShared.so` JIT fault),
making CI non-deterministically fail.

## What Was Done

1. Grep'd actual `fn test_[a-z]` count (31, not 25 as issue stated)
2. Planned 4 logical groupings by functional area
3. Created `test_utility_part1.mojo` (7 tests): copy/clone, property accessors, strides
4. Created `test_utility_part2.mojo` (7 tests): contiguity, item(), tolist()
5. Created `test_utility_part3.mojo` (9 tests): `__len__`, `__setitem__`, `__bool__`, hash edge cases
6. Created `test_utility_part4.mojo` (8 tests): type conversions, str/repr, hash, diff()
7. Added ADR-009 header comment to each new file
8. Deleted original file with `git rm`
9. Updated `.github/workflows/comprehensive-tests.yml` Core Utilities pattern (explicit filename list)
10. All pre-commit hooks passed on first attempt

## Key Observations

- Issue description said 25 tests, actual was 31. Always grep to verify.
- This CI group used an explicit filename list (not a glob), so the workflow needed updating.
  Compare with issue #3409 where a glob auto-picked up new files automatically.
- Initial plan for part4 had 10 tests; redistributed 2 hash tests to part3 to achieve ≤8 target.
- `validate_test_coverage.py` automatically validates that all new test files appear in the CI
  workflow pattern — catches both missing files and missing workflow entries.

## Files Changed

- `tests/shared/core/test_utility.mojo` — DELETED
- `tests/shared/core/test_utility_part1.mojo` — CREATED (7 tests)
- `tests/shared/core/test_utility_part2.mojo` — CREATED (7 tests)
- `tests/shared/core/test_utility_part3.mojo` — CREATED (9 tests)
- `tests/shared/core/test_utility_part4.mojo` — CREATED (8 tests)
- `.github/workflows/comprehensive-tests.yml` — UPDATED (Core Utilities pattern)

# Session Notes: ADR-009 Test Split for test_checkpointing.mojo (Issue #3496)

## Session Context

- **Date**: 2026-03-08
- **Issue**: #3496 — `tests/shared/training/test_checkpointing.mojo` contained 13 `fn test_` functions
- **ADR-009 limit**: ≤10 per file
- **Branch**: `3496-auto-impl`
- **PR**: #4372

## Problem

`tests/shared/training/test_checkpointing.mojo` had 13 `fn test_` functions, exceeding ADR-009's
limit of ≤10 per file. This caused intermittent heap corruption crashes in Mojo v0.26.1
(`libKGENCompilerRTShared.so` JIT fault), making the Shared Infra CI group non-deterministically
fail.

## Original file test inventory (13 tests)

```text
fn test_checkpoint_save_and_load
fn test_checkpoint_metadata
fn test_checkpoint_save_frequency
fn test_checkpoint_no_save_on_non_multiple
fn test_checkpoint_save_best_only_improves
fn test_checkpoint_save_best_only_no_improve
fn test_checkpoint_best_value_tracking_min_mode
fn test_checkpoint_best_value_tracking_max_mode
fn test_checkpoint_min_mode
fn test_checkpoint_max_mode
fn test_checkpoint_auto_mode_loss
fn test_checkpoint_auto_mode_accuracy
fn test_checkpoint_empty_metrics
```

## What Was Done

1. Read the issue prompt to understand requirements
2. Read the original `test_checkpointing.mojo` (13 tests)
3. Checked `.github/workflows/comprehensive-tests.yml` — the Shared Infra group uses pattern
   `training/test_*.mojo` (glob), which auto-picks up split files — no workflow changes needed
4. Checked `validate_test_coverage.py` — found explicit filename reference to `test_checkpointing.mojo`
   in an exclusion list; replaced 1 entry with 2 entries for `test_checkpointing_part1.mojo` and
   `test_checkpointing_part2.mojo`
5. Created `test_checkpointing_part1.mojo` (8 tests): core save/load, metadata, save_frequency,
   save_best_only, best value tracking
6. Created `test_checkpointing_part2.mojo` (5 tests): mode tests (min/max/auto), edge cases
7. Added ADR-009 header comment to both files
8. Deleted the original file with `git rm`
9. All pre-commit hooks passed on first attempt
10. Pushed and created PR #4372 with `gh pr merge --auto --rebase`

## Key Observations

- CI glob pattern `training/test_*.mojo` auto-matched new split files — no workflow YAML change needed.
  This is the same pattern as issue #3409 (Core Activations); contrast with #3424 (Core Utilities)
  which used an explicit filename list and required workflow updates.
- `validate_test_coverage.py` had a separate explicit exclusion list with `test_checkpointing.mojo`
  hardcoded. This is NOT covered by the CI glob. Lesson: glob in CI workflow does NOT mean glob
  everywhere — always check `validate_test_coverage.py` independently.
- Split at natural section boundaries: part1 covers core save/load behavior and frequency/best-only
  logic; part2 covers mode-specific behavior and edge cases.
- All pre-commit hooks passed first attempt: mojo format, validate_test_coverage, mypy, ruff,
  check-yaml.

## Files Changed

- `tests/shared/training/test_checkpointing.mojo` — DELETED
- `tests/shared/training/test_checkpointing_part1.mojo` — CREATED (8 tests)
- `tests/shared/training/test_checkpointing_part2.mojo` — CREATED (5 tests)
- `scripts/validate_test_coverage.py` — UPDATED (replaced 1 filename entry with 2)

# Session Notes: ADR-009 Test Split for test_composed_op.mojo (Issue #3627)

## Session Context

- **Date**: 2026-03-08
- **Issue**: #3627 — `tests/shared/core/test_composed_op.mojo` contained 12 `fn test_` functions
- **ADR-009 limit**: ≤10 per file
- **Branch**: `3627-auto-impl`
- **PR**: #4421

## Problem

`tests/shared/core/test_composed_op.mojo` had 12 `fn test_` functions, exceeding ADR-009's
limit of ≤10 per file. This caused intermittent heap corruption crashes in Mojo v0.26.1
(`libKGENCompilerRTShared.so` JIT fault), making the Core NN Modules CI group non-deterministically
fail.

## Original file test inventory (12 tests)

```text
fn test_composed_op_initialization
fn test_composed_op_implements_differentiable
fn test_composed_op_implements_composable
fn test_composed_op_forward_chains_operations
fn test_composed_op_forward_caches_intermediate
fn test_composed_op_forward_shape_preservation
fn test_composed_op_backward_applies_chain_rule
fn test_composed_op_backward_shape_preservation
fn test_composed_op_backward_multiple_passes
fn test_composed_op_forward_backward_roundtrip
fn test_composed_op_with_different_scales
fn test_composed_op_identity_composition
```

## What Was Done

1. Read the issue prompt and the original `test_composed_op.mojo` (366 lines, 12 tests)
2. Checked `.github/workflows/comprehensive-tests.yml` — the `Core Utilities` group uses an
   explicit filename list (not a glob); `test_composed_op.mojo` was directly named → workflow
   update required
3. Checked `scripts/validate_test_coverage.py` — no direct filename reference found; uses glob
   patterns → no changes needed to coverage script
4. Created `test_composed_op_part1.mojo` (7 tests): initialization, trait checks, forward pass
5. Created `test_composed_op_part2.mojo` (5 tests): backward pass, integration tests
6. Added ADR-009 header comment to both files
7. Deleted the original file with `rm`
8. Updated CI workflow pattern (replaced `test_composed_op.mojo` with
   `test_composed_op_part1.mojo test_composed_op_part2.mojo`)
9. All pre-commit hooks passed on first attempt: mojo format, validate_test_coverage, check-yaml
10. Pushed and created PR #4421 with `gh pr merge --auto --rebase`

## Key Observations

- CI group `Core Utilities` uses an explicit filename list → workflow YAML must be updated.
  This mirrors issue #3424 (Core Utilities) pattern.
- `validate_test_coverage.py` had no direct reference — the grep for `test_composed_op`
  returned no matches in that script. Glob-based discovery handled it automatically.
- Mock structs (`ScaleMul`, `ScaleAdd`) must be duplicated in both part files since Mojo v0.26.1
  has no `#include` mechanism. Both files also need their own full import block.
- The issue count (12) matched the actual grep count exactly — no discrepancy this time.
- Split grouping: part1 covers initialization + all forward pass tests + one integration-style
  test (`test_composed_op_with_different_scales`); part2 covers backward pass + integration.

- `tests/shared/core/test_composed_op_part2.mojo` — CREATED (5 tests)
