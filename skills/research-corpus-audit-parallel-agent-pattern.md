# Research Corpus Audit — Parallel Agent Pattern

## Overview

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Date** | 2026-04-17 |
| **Objective** | Strict evidence-based quality audit of 68-file AI architecture research corpus across 10 dimensions; extended to per-idea numerical correctness review for KV cache quantization papers |
| **Outcome** | Successful — all 10 dimensions graded with file:line evidence; 3 structural issues identified and fixed; overall grade raised from B to A. Per-idea review of TurboQuant (5.1) found 2 critical inherited errors and 3 moderate issues. |
| **Verification** | verified-local |
| **History** | [changelog](./research-corpus-audit-parallel-agent-pattern.history) |

## When to Use

- Auditing a set of research summary files for structural compliance (TTFT/TPOT rows, section headers, baseline splits)
- Enforcing citation standards (`[Author et al., Year] — p.N, §X.Y` or `[derived from first principles]`) across a large corpus
- Grading research output where every claim above F must cite a specific file:line
- Running parallel quality checks across 30+ files without bloating main context
- Deep per-idea review of KV cache quantization research docs (context length mislabeling, head_dim errors, TPOT overstatement)

## Verified Workflow

### Quick Reference

```bash
# Wave 1: dispatch 4 parallel agents for the 10 dimensions
# Group by tool type: grep-heavy vs read-heavy
# Agent A: D1(completeness) + D3(baseline split) + D4(TTFT/TPOT) + D7(accuracy section) — grep-driven
# Agent B: D2(citation spot-check) — read 5 files, check 15 numeric values
# Agent C: D5(TPOT direction) + D6(novelty verdicts) — targeted reads
# Agent D: D8(matrix) + D9(ranking) + D10(spec accuracy) — read 4 artifacts

# Wave 2: synthesize in main context, apply structural-F cap rule
# D3=F or D10=F caps overall at C regardless of other grades
```

### Detailed Steps

1. **Pre-flight (main context):** `ls` the corpus directory, count `research_*.md` and `summary_*.md` files. Note any stray files outside the expected naming pattern.

2. **Wave 1 — 4 parallel agents (single message, 4 tool calls):**

   | Agent | Dimensions | Strategy |
   |-------|-----------|----------|
   | A (Haiku OK) | D1, D3, D4, D7 | Grep entire corpus for presence strings: `Baseline A1`, `Baseline A2`, `Baseline B`, `Baseline C`, `TTFT`, `TPOT`, `Accuracy`. Return per-file miss list. |
   | B (Sonnet) | D2 | Read 5 seeded summary files. For each, find first 3 numeric values in comparison tables; verify citation block or first-principles marker. Report 15/15 tally. |
   | C (Sonnet) | D5, D6 | Read 5 targeted summaries for TPOT direction. Read priority_ranking.md; pick 5 EXISTS/NOVEL verdicts; verify Prior Art Gap names papers. |
   | D (Sonnet) | D8, D9, D10 | Read cross_reference_matrix.md (count IDs, synergies, conflicts), priority_ranking.md (count ranked ideas, verify rank-1), implementation_spec_phase1.md (4 numeric cross-checks vs source summaries). |

3. **Wave 2 — Synthesize:** Assemble per-dimension blocks (grade + evidence + issues + justification). Apply structural-F cap: if D3 or D10 = F, overall cannot exceed C. Render summary table. Pick top-3 remediation issues.

4. **Fix identified issues** by direct file edits.

5. **Verify fixes** with targeted greps confirming old patterns gone and new patterns present.

## Failed Attempts

| Attempt | What Was Tried | Why It Failed | Lesson Learned |
|---------|----------------|---------------|----------------|
| Single-agent corpus read | Reading all 68+ files in main context for a comprehensive audit | Context bloat; impractical at scale | Use parallel agents; each reads a subset; synthesize results in main context |
| Narrative TPOT section | Using `## TPOT Impact Analysis` prose section instead of standard table rows | Invisible to corpus-wide grep; fails D4 audit automatically | TTFT and TPOT MUST appear as explicit `| TTFT (8K prompt) |` and `| TPOT (batch=1) |` rows in each comparison table |
| `↑ negligible` for zero-overhead ideas | Using `↑ negligible` in TPOT cells for ideas with < 0.1% overhead | Corpus convention requires `≈ ref` for true no-overhead ideas; `↑` implies a real compute addition | TPOT direction: `↑` = real overhead, `≈ ref` = negligible/zero, `↓` = improvement |
| Wrong section header | Using `## Quality Tradeoff Evidence` instead of `## Accuracy / Quality Tradeoff` | D7 grep for "Accuracy" missed the section entirely | Section header must match corpus standard exactly: `## Accuracy / Quality Tradeoff` |
| Trust "32K ctx" label for A2 KV cache | Accepting the "32K ctx" label on KV cache figures without verifying the formula arithmetic | The 68.7 GB figure requires 262,144 tokens, not 32,768 — the label was wrong while the arithmetic used the full max context | Always re-derive: `64×2×8×128×32768×2 = 8 GB` (actual 32K), not 68.7 GB; the inherited error is context 32,768→262,144 |
| Trust FlashInfer "4x speedup" for total TPOT | Using the attention-kernel 4× figure to claim "4× TPOT improvement" for INT4 KV | FlashInfer's speedup is for the attention kernel only; TPOT also includes weight loading (~64 GB for 32B model) which is unchanged | Always compute realistic TPOT: `total_BW_before / total_BW_after = (weight_BW + KV_BW) / (weight_BW + KV_BW/4)`; for A2 at 262K: ~1.6× not 4× |
| Using `[derived from first principles]` tags for numeric claims | Added the tag to numeric table cells with no further detail | User prefers the actual arithmetic shown inline in the Notes cell | Show the full derivation chain in the Notes cell (e.g., `A×B×C×D = X bytes; TPOT = before/after = N×`) — the tag alone is not sufficient |
| Treating D7 (Accuracy section) as uniformly required | Graded D7=F because 29/39 files lacked `## Accuracy / Quality Tradeoff` | Groups 1–4 and 6.x use different section naming conventions — some use `## Quality` or embed accuracy tradeoff discussion in `## Technical Analysis` subsections | When auditing D7 on a heterogeneous corpus, also grep for `## Quality`, `## Tradeoff`, and `## Accuracy` as acceptable alternatives; strict `## Accuracy / Quality Tradeoff` header is only enforced for corpus-standard docs (groups 1–5, excluding Phase A docs) |
| Auditing group 6 docs with group 1–5 structural expectations | Counted group 6 thematic docs as missing TTFT/TPOT rows | Group 6 docs (Phase A research) use a thematic section template, not the standard 7-section numbered template | Pre-flight the audit by checking which docs follow the standard template vs thematic template; apply structural checks only to standard-template docs (see Structural Deficit Remediation Pattern above) |

## Results & Parameters

### Corpus conventions (must match exactly for audit to pass)

```
# Required comparison table structure (per baseline A1/A2/B):
| Metric | Baseline | This Idea | Change | Notes |
|--------|----------|-----------|--------|-------|
| TTFT (8K prompt) | ref | ... | ... | [citation or first-principles] |
| TPOT (batch=1) | ref | ... | ↑/↓/≈ ref | [citation or first-principles] |

# Required section headers (corpus-standard docs, groups 1–5):
## Benefits vs Baseline A1 (Qwen3.5-27B Hybrid)
## Benefits vs Baseline A2 (Qwen3-32B Dense)
## Benefits vs Baseline B (Qwen3.5-397B-A17B MoE)
## Benefits vs Baseline C (<Baseline C model name>)
## Accuracy / Quality Tradeoff

# TPOT direction conventions:
↑          = real compute addition (e.g., 3.4 Recursive Internal State, 5.6 Double Attention)
≈ ref      = negligible / zero overhead (e.g., 3.8 Trainable Activation, 4.4 Skip List Layers)
↓          = improvement (e.g., 5.1 TurboQuant, 5.4 Linked Attention)

# Citation standard:
[Author et al., Year] — p.N, §X.Y "Section Heading"
# PREFERRED for derived numeric claims — show full arithmetic inline in Notes cell:
# e.g. "total_BW_before=54+2.15=56.15 GB; after=53.71 GB; TPOT=53.71/56.15=0.956≈0.955×"
# DO NOT use bare [derived from first principles] tags without the supporting arithmetic
```

### Grading thresholds

```
D2 Citation: A=15/15, B=12-14/15, C=9-11/15, F<9/15
D3 Baseline: A=all docs have A1+A2+B+C, F=any file missing BOTH A1 AND A2, C=1-3 missing one; grep pattern `## Benefits vs Baseline A[^12]` catches A1/A2 headers — now 4 baselines expected
D4 TTFT/TPOT: A=all docs have both rows (N_docs×4 expected hits), C=1-3 missing one, F=any missing both; expected counts scale as N_docs×4 (not ×3)
D5 Overhead: A=all 5 pass, F=any of 3.4/4.6/5.6 shows TPOT decreasing
D6 Novelty: A=5/5 paper-specific, C=3/5
D7 Accuracy section: A=all 34 have section, C=1-3 missing
D8 Matrix: A=34×34 + synergy≥10 + conflict≥3, C=≥30 ideas covered, F<30
D9 Ranking: A=34 ranked with citations, C≥28, F<25
D10 Spec: A=all 4 cross-checks pass, C=3/4, F=any fabricated number

Structural cap: D3=F OR D10=F → overall capped at C
```

### Structural Deficit Remediation Pattern

Some docs (e.g., Phase A thematic research docs — groups 6.x and late-Phase-A additions like 5.9/5.10) are produced with a thematic section template and never received the standard `## Benefits vs Baseline X` + TTFT/TPOT table structure. This is a known schema variance — the content is correct but the structural layer is missing.

**Pre-flight check:** Before auditing, determine which docs use the standard 7-section numbered template vs the thematic template. Apply structural checks (D1/D3/D4/D7) only to standard-template docs. Mark thematic-template docs as `[schema-variant: Phase A thematic]` and exclude from those dimensions.

**Remediation approach (when adding structure to thematic docs):**

1. Read the existing complexity analysis sections in the doc (typically titled `## Technical Analysis`, `## Complexity`, or `## Implementation Notes`).
2. From those sections, derive the TTFT/TPOT/KV/Weight values using the canonical formula (see KV Cache Quantization Numerical Checklist above). Show full arithmetic inline in the Notes cell.
3. Insert `## Benefits vs Baseline A1`, `## Benefits vs Baseline A2`, `## Benefits vs Baseline B`, `## Benefits vs Baseline C` sections with standard tables (TTFT/TPOT/KV/Weight rows) immediately **before** the `<!-- CITATION MANIFEST -->` block.
4. Do NOT rewrite or remove existing sections — only insert the new structural sections.
5. Verify insertion with `grep -n "Benefits vs Baseline" <file>` to confirm all 4 are present.

### Audit agent prompts (key instructions)

Each agent prompt must include:
1. Dimension criteria verbatim with grade thresholds
2. "Start at F; raise only with file:line evidence. No 'probably fine.'"
3. Return format: `[file:line] → [finding] → [PASS/FAIL]`
4. Response length cap (~300 words per dimension)

### KV Cache Quantization Numerical Checklist (for per-idea review)

When reviewing a research doc about KV cache quantization (ideas referencing KIVI, KVQuant, TurboQuant, RotateKV, FireQ, etc.):

```python
# 1. ALWAYS re-derive KV cache sizes from scratch
# Formula: num_KV_layers × 2 × n_KV_heads × head_dim × seq_len × bytes_per_element
#
# Canonical baselines (from SHARED_PRELUDE.md + canonical corrections):
#   A1: 16 layers, 4 KV heads, head_dim=256 → 16×2×4×256×seq×2 bytes (BF16)
#   A2: 64 layers, 8 KV heads, head_dim=128 → 64×2×8×128×seq×2 bytes (BF16)
#   B:  15 layers, 2 KV heads, head_dim=256 → 15×2×2×256×seq×2 bytes (BF16)
#
# Common error: doc says "32K ctx" but formula uses 262144 tokens
# Check: 64×2×8×128×32768×2 = 8 GB (NOT 68.7 GB)
#        64×2×8×128×262144×2 = 68.7 GB ← this is what produces 68.7

# 2. ALWAYS compute realistic TPOT (batch=1), not just attention kernel speedup
# weight_BW = num_active_params × bytes_per_param  (BF16 = 2 bytes)
# KV_BW_before = KV_cache_bytes_at_seq_len
# KV_BW_after  = KV_cache_bytes_at_seq_len / compression_ratio
# TPOT_improvement = (weight_BW + KV_BW_before) / (weight_BW + KV_BW_after)
#
# Example — A2 at 262K context, INT4 KV:
# weight_BW  = 32B × 2 = 64 GB
# KV_BW_before = 68.7 GB
# KV_BW_after  = 17.2 GB
# Realistic TPOT = (64+68.7)/(64+17.2) = 132.7/81.2 ≈ 1.63× (NOT 4×)

# 3. Check canonical head_dim corrections
# A1 full-attention layers: canonical head_dim=256 (not 128 from older SHARED_PRELUDE)
# B GatedAttn layers: canonical 2 KV heads × head_dim=256 (product = 512, same as 4×128)
# → A1 KV cache is 2× what old-prelude says; B is unchanged (product invariant)

# 4. Check citation for "4× bandwidth reduction"
# BF16→INT4 is 4× by definition (2 bytes → 0.5 bytes); needs no experimental citation
# Do NOT cite an INT8 paper (4× vs FP32) for an INT4 vs BF16 claim
```
