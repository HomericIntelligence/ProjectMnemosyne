# ProjectMnemosyne

ProjectMnemosyne is a repository dedicated to storing, organizing, and sharing agentic skills, code artifacts, and knowledge resources. Named after Mnemosyne, the Greek goddess of memory, this project serves as the collective memory of the agentic ecosystem. It ensures that agents can recall, reuse, and refine capabilities across workflows, enabling continuous improvement and long-term growth.

## Purpose

While ProjectOdyssey focuses on training and capability development, ProjectKeystone establishes communication and coordination, and ProjectScylla provides testing and optimization, ProjectMnemosyne is the library of wisdom. It is the place where agentic knowledge is preserved, codified, and made accessible for future use.

## This repository is designed to:
- 📚 Store Skills: Maintain a structured archive of Claude code skills, reusable modules, and agentic patterns.
- 🧠 Preserve Knowledge: Capture agentic strategies, workflows, and decision-making heuristics for reuse.
- 🔄 Enable Reuse: Provide a central hub where agents can draw upon existing skills rather than reinventing them.
- 🚀 Support Growth: Facilitate continuous improvement by building on past knowledge and refining capabilities.

## Core Concepts

- Skill Codex: A curated collection of agentic skills and code snippets.
- Knowledge Base: Documentation of agentic strategies, workflows, and lessons learned.
- Versioned Artifacts: Skills and modules tracked for evolution and improvement over time.
- Interoperability: Designed to integrate seamlessly with other projects in the ecosystem.

## Why Mnemosyne?

Mnemosyne embodies memory, continuity, and the preservation of wisdom. By naming this repository after her, we highlight its role as the memory layer of the agentic ecosystem. Just as memory allows humans to learn, adapt, and grow, ProjectMnemosyne ensures agents can build upon prior knowledge to achieve excellence.

## Ecosystem

- ProjectOdyssey → Training and capability development.
- ProjectKeystone → Communication and distributed agent coordination.
- ProjectScylla → Testing, measurement, and optimization under trial.
- ProjectMnemosyne → Knowledge, skills, and memory preservation.

Together, these projects form a cohesive framework for building, connecting, testing, and refining agentic workflows.
